# scoop-bucket
A scoop bucket containing all sorts I find useful.

Current available packages:
| package name | scoop name | version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PowerShell Core | pscore | 7.0.3 |
| sampctl | sampctl | 1.9.1 |

## Install Scoop
```ps
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser
iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex
```

## Add this bucket
```
scoop bucket add devlexanderxyz https://github.com/devlexanderxyz/scoop-bucket.git
```
